# ZOGU Solutions: GitHub & Netlify Deployment Guide (Beginner Friendly)

Welcome! This guide will walk you through deploying your production-ready ZOGU Solutions application using a modern, professional workflow. We'll use the web interfaces for GitHub and Netlify, so **no command line or console is needed**.

Let's get your app live on the internet!

---

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Backend (The App's "Brain")

This part is the same as before. Your app needs a "brain" to store all its data (users, products, invoices, etc.). We will use a free service called **Supabase** for this.

*(If you have already completed this from a previous guide, you can skip to Part 2, but make sure you have your API keys ready!)*

### Step 1.1: Create a Supabase Account and Project

1.  Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and click **"Start your project"**.
2.  Sign up for a new account (the free plan is perfect).
3.  Once you're logged in, click **"New project"**.
4.  Give your project a **Name** (e.g., `zogu-solutions-app`).
5.  Create a secure **Database Password** (save this somewhere safe!).
6.  Choose a **Region** that is closest to you.
7.  Click **"Create new project"**. It will take a few minutes to set up.

### Step 1.2: Get Your API Keys

These keys are like a secret password that lets your app talk to its "brain". We will add them securely in the final deployment step.

1.  After your project is ready, look for the **Settings** icon (a gear) on the left menu and click it.
2.  In the settings menu, click on **API**.
3.  You will see two important things under "Project API keys":
    *   **Project URL:** A web address that looks like `https://xxxxxxxx.supabase.co`
    *   **anon public Key:** A very long string of random characters.
4.  **Copy these two values into a temporary text file.** We will need them later when we configure Netlify.

### Step 1.3: Set Up the Database Structure

This step tells your app's brain what kind of information to store. We'll do this by running a special script.

1.  In your Supabase project, look for the **SQL Editor** icon (looks like a database with `SQL` on it) on the left menu and click it.
2.  Click **"+ New query"**.
3.  Go to the file named `supabase_schema.sql` that was provided with the project code. Open it, select ALL the text inside, and copy it.
4.  Paste the entire script into the Supabase SQL Editor.
5.  Click the green **"RUN"** button. You should see a "Success" message.

### Step 1.4: Secure Your Database with Row Level Security

This is the most important step to make your application secure and functional. This script enables a "firewall" on your data, ensuring users can only see and manage data from their own organization.

1.  In your Supabase **SQL Editor**, click **"+ New query"** again.
2.  Copy the **entire** SQL script from the `supabase_rls.sql` file and paste it into the editor.
3.  Click the green **"RUN"** button. This script is safe to run multiple times.

**Your backend is now fully configured!**

## Part 2 (Recommended): Connecting to GitHub From the Editor

This is the modern, automated way to get your code onto GitHub. It's easier and better than dragging files manually.

### Step 2.1: Create an Empty GitHub Repository

1.  Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account if you don't have one.
2.  Once logged in, click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner, and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a **Name** (e.g., `zogu-solutions-app`).
4.  Make sure the repository is set to **Public**.
5.  **Do not** check any boxes like "Add a README file". We want it to be completely empty.
6.  Click **"Create repository"**.
7.  On the new repository page, click the **"Code"** button and copy the **HTTPS** URL. It will look like `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`.

### Step 2.2: Connect Your Editor to GitHub

1.  In this code editor, find the **Source Control** icon on the left-hand side (it looks like a branching fork). Click it.
2.  You should see a button that says **"Initialize Repository"**. Click it. The editor will now track all your project files.
3.  In the Source Control panel, look for a "..." (More Actions) menu. Click it, then go to **Remote > Add Remote**.
4.  A box will appear. **Paste the HTTPS URL** you copied from GitHub into this box and press Enter.
5.  Another box will ask for a remote name. Type `origin` and press Enter.

### Step 2.3: Push Your Code to GitHub

1.  You will see a list of all your project files under "Changes".
2.  Above the list, there is a "Message" box. Type a short message, like `Initial commit`.
3.  Click the **"Commit"** button (it might be a checkmark icon).
4.  Now, click the **"Sync Changes"** or **"Push"** button to upload all your committed files to GitHub. You may be asked to log in to your GitHub account to authorize the editor.

**Verification:** Go back to your GitHub repository page in your browser and refresh. You should see all your code, including the `src` folder, neatly organized.

**Congratulations! Your code is now safely stored on GitHub.**

## Part 3: Deploying to Netlify (Making it Live!)

Netlify is a service that will build your application from the code on GitHub and host it on the internet.

### Step 3.1: Create a Netlify Account and Connect to GitHub

1.  Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and click **"Sign up"**. It's easiest to sign up using your GitHub account.
2.  After signing up, you'll be on your Netlify dashboard. Click **"Add new site"** and then select **"Import an existing project"**.
3.  Under "Connect to Git provider", click the **GitHub** button. You will be asked to authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories.

### Step 3.2: Select Your Repository and Configure Settings

1.  After connecting to GitHub, you will see a list of your repositories. Find the one you just created (`zogu-solutions-app`) and click on it.
2.  You will be taken to the "Deploy settings" page. Netlify is smart and should automatically detect the correct settings for a Vite project. Verify they are as follows:
    *   **Build command:** `npm run build`
    *   **Publish directory:** `dist`
3.  **This is the most important step:** We need to add your secret API keys so Netlify can use them during the build.
    *   Click on **"Show advanced"**, then **"New variable"**.
    *   You will add **three** variables, one by one. Use the keys you saved from Supabase in Step 1.2.
    *   **Variable 1:**
        *   Key: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
        *   Value: *Paste your Supabase Project URL here*
    *   **Variable 2:**
        *   Key: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
        *   Value: *Paste your Supabase anon public Key here*
    *   **Variable 3 (Optional - for the AI Chatbot):**
        *   Key: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
        *   Value: *Paste your Google AI Studio API Key here*
4.  After adding the variables, click the **"Deploy site"** button.

### Step 3.3: Visit Your Live Website!

Netlify will now start building and deploying your site. You can watch the progress in the "Deploys" tab. This will take a few minutes.

Once it's done, you'll see a message that says **"Published"**. Netlify will give you a public web address (like `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`).

**Click on it, and your ZOGU Solutions application is live on the internet!** Any time you push new changes to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically redeploy your site with the updates.
